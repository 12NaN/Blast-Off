StaphBrowser Annotation workflow

Starting with a BLAST result summary (.blast file)

1. Select a blast result file, make a folder for this gene
2. Open the file in Excel, sort by %query coverage (col-E) and  %identity (col-D)
3. Count the rows – are there matches for all 161 genomes?
4. Look at the worst matches – test by blastp
	https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
5. Decide at what level of %identity should be the cutoff for the same gene (orthologs)
6. Look at short fragment matches with blastp – trace back to genome assembly, make protein>DNA Blast (tblastn)
7. Count total number of alleles
8. Download list of all matching proteins, save as text file
9. Upload list to Batch ENTREZ, download FASTA file of protein sequences – save!
	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez
10. Upload FASTA file to EBI Clustal, save text file of multiple alignment
	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo
11. Upload multiple alignment to EMBOSS>showalign, save text file of simplified mult-alignment.

12. Fill out Ortholog Report form, save all relevant files to the folder for this gene. Submit completed folders to Professor Brogun
